# Neo Habitat installer
This is the installer for the Neo Habitat project found at http://neohabitat.org

# Build the installer
This software was made with the InstallForge installer creater. If you want to build it, download InstallForge (Install forge download: https://installforge.net/) and open the .ifp file in the source code. All other files must be in the same directory as the .ifp file. Then to build it, go to the "Build" catagory and select "Build." Then select where to export the Setup file. Then press the button that looks like a program to build it. You can also select the Build button in the top bar.

# Update the software
To update the software, in InstallForge go to the "Files" tab in the "Setup" catagory. Select the files already there and delete them by pressing the "Remove" button (You can also press remove all.) To add the new files, press "Add Folder" and add the Habitat directory. Then you can build it by following the earlier instructions
